## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r cars}
data <- read.csv("FIFADataset.csv")
subdata <- select(data, Name, Agility, Acceleration, Club)
subdata <- filter(subdata, Club == "Real Madrid CF" | Club =="FC Barcelona" | Club =="FC Bayern Munich")
head(subdata)
```
## Factors to numerical
```{r}
subdata$Agility <- as.numeric(subdata$Agility)
subdata$Acceleration <- as.numeric(subdata$Acceleration)
```


## EdA

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(subdata, agility, acceleration)
cor(subdata$Acceleration, subdata$Agility)
```

Linear regression model
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(Acceleration ~ Agility, subdata)
mod2 <- lm(Agility ~ Acceleration, subdata)
summary(mod1)
summary(mod2)
```
```{r}
#Calculating the B_1: B_1 = cov(x,y) / var(x)
cov(subdata$Agility, subdata$Acceleration)/var(subdata$Agility)
```

R^2 tells you how good is the model. Adjusted R^2 penalizes the number of coefficients.
### Residuals information
Assumptions: follow a normal with mu = 0 and sd dev = sd dev (normally distributed), independent.
How are the residuals compute?
Solving the normal equations.
If residuals are standarized, we will have them between -1.96 and 1.96 (99% of them).

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mod1)
```

## ANOVA
```{r}
anova(mod1)
anova(mod2)
```

## Exercise 3: Analyze the FIFA dataset modeling the Acceleration as a function of: agility, sprint.speed, reactins and balance.

```{r}
head(data)

subdata <- select(data, Club, Name, Agility, Sprint.speed, Reactions, Balance, Acceleration)
subdata <- filter(subdata, Club == "Real Madrid CF" | Club =="FC Barcelona" | Club =="Manchester City")
head(subdata)
```

Casting values to numerical data where it is necessary
```{r}
subdata = subdata %>%  mutate(Agility=as.numeric(Agility), Sprint.speed = as.numeric(Sprint.speed), Reactions = as.numeric(Reactions), Balance = as.numeric(Balance),  Acceleration = as.numeric(Acceleration))


```

Creating the linear model
```{r}
mod3 <- lm(Acceleration ~ Agility + Sprint.speed + Reactions + Balance, subdata)
summary(mod3)
```
